# BNHM RShiny Server
a place to host bnhm specific shiny apps.

# Instructions for submitting shiny applications

Your application for running a shiny application on the bnhm-shiny server requires the following:
  * Send email to bnhm@berkeley.edu with your name, class affiliation and link to a github repo containing your shiny application
  * The github repository must clearly include a list of package dependencies on the README.md homepage.
  * While we don't strictly enforce coding standards, we expect all code to be well-written and clearly documented using code comments and Markdown to explain what your application is meant to do.
