# BNHM Shiny Server
A place to host Berkeley Natural History Museum (shiny)[https://shiny.rstudio.com/] applications.  See the bottom of this page for links to applications which are hosted on the BNHM shiny server.  These are applications which have been submitted to the BNHM review team and have passed several checks.  

# Instructions for submitting shiny applications

Your application for running a shiny application on the bnhm-shiny server requires the following:
  * Send email to bnhm@berkeley.edu with your name, class affiliation and link to a github repo containing your shiny application
  * Include a list of package dependencies on the README.md homepage under a '# Dependencies' heading.
  * Ensure your code is well-written and clearly documented using code comments and Markdown to explain what your application is meant to do.
  * Maintain your code on your github repository
 
Please note that BNHM does not guarrantee continued availability of shiny applications that have passed review and may remove the applications at any time.  However, we will do our best to give users a warning if the application needs to come down or if the server will not be available.
